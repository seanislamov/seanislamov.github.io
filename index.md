### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    In Lab 11, Part 2, I really enjoyed working on the Object-Oriented Hi-Lo Game because I felt like a game developer learning how to create a game. It was very cool and it turned out great. I had to use the RandomSecretNumber function to work with the code.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was an interested lab for me because im Part 2, I had to compute the average mean of all elements of a vector except the minimum and the maximum. This was cool because I was workin with vectors and trying to compute an Olympic Judge average.

* Lab 8

    In Lab 8, I had to create a word game called Mad Libs in Part 1 which I found very challenging and fun. This game is a funny game and programming it was an awesome experience. I had to work with command-line arguments.
